            In the heart of Europe lies a city responsible for so much bad but
            also good, a people who have struggled but also made others struggle
            too.

            Dated back to the 13th century, Berlin is the Capital of Germany, a
            city renowned for its historical buildings, history and modern art.
            It is the place to be for any aspiring artist interested in the
            modern art scene.

            The post war state of the country made way for modern advancement
            and ideas in the realm of architecture which paved the way for ideas
            like Brutalism and Minimalism, Berlin is a center for a modern and
            proggresive views concerning topics such as politics, globar warming
            and inclusive rights for Lgbtq and ethnic populations.

          <p class="textFood">
            Plagued by the guilt of their past, Germany and the German people
            are dead set on changing the world for the better, by introducing
            new ideas for buildings, rights for minorities or a proggresive
            geo-political stance, Berlin is certainly looking towards the
            future.
